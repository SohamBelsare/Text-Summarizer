# Text-Summarizer
Summarizer-FastAPI is an open-source project designed to provide a simple yet powerful text summarization service. Leveraging Sentence-BERT (SBERT) for semantic understanding, the project utilizes a sentence summarizer algorithm to generate concise and coherent summaries of input text.

# Features:

SBERT Integration: Utilizes Sentence-BERT (SBERT) to capture the semantic meaning of sentences, enhancing the quality of text summarization.
Sentence Summarizer Algorithm: Implements an effective sentence summarization algorithm to generate coherent and informative summaries from the given text.
Bootstrap UI: Incorporates a user-friendly and responsive web interface powered by Bootstrap, making it easy for users to input text and view the summarized results.
FastAPI Backend: Utilizes FastAPI to create a high-performance backend for handling API requests, ensuring rapid and efficient communication between the frontend and backend.
Summarization Options: Provides options for users to choose different summarization parameters or algorithms, allowing customization based on specific requirements.
Input Validation: Implements robust input validation to handle various types of text inputs and ensure the proper functioning of the summarization process.
Easy Deployment: Includes documentation and scripts for easy deployment, enabling users to set up their summarization service quickly.
Dependencies:

Sentence-BERT (SBERT)
Bootstrap for the frontend
FastAPI for the backend
Any required Python libraries for text processing and summarization
